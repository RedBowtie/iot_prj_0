# Introductions

This is a project of IoT. And unfortunately, I'm afraid the call of mqtt functions within the template I got is not in the standard way. So I guess the repo wil have no meaning other than a record of some hours I spent on this course.

If I had chance to design this things by myself, I would be happy to follow the official documents.

Thanks to Dave Gamble for his JSON parser in C, and here is the original [repo](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON), I suppose?
