# Introductions

This is a project of IoT. And unfortunately, I'm afraid the call of mqtt functions within the template I got is not in the standard way. So I guess the repo wil have no meaning other than a record of some hours I spent on this course.

If I had chance to design this things by myself, I would be happy to follow the official documents.

Thanks to Dave Gamble for his JSON parser in C, and here is the original [repo](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON), I suppose? Because the file just came with the template delivered from the instructor, without any clarification. I don't like this.

## Brief Usage

To compile the files

```shell
$ make 
``` 

Run the executable

```shell
$ ./smart_home
``` 

## How this works

## END

Wish everyone that you don't have to deal with the bad instructors and modify their *original* template, or use any *valuable software* they developed.

And they won't even listen to you, because you're not paying for the software.
